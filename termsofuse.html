You must provide clear disclosure that you impose a surcharge that is not greater than your applicable merchant discount rate for credit card transactions.

Except where early termination occurs due to force majeure (as defined below), if Licensee terminates this Agreement prior to the end of any Term specified in a Sales Order Form, Licensee shall immediately pay all charges that would be due to the Company through the end of the Term (the “Termination Fee”), calculated based on the remaining number of months of the Term, at a monthly rate based on the total monthly charges for the month immediately prior to the Termination. Licensee acknowledges that such Termination Fee is not a penalty but is in the nature of a liquidated damage in connection with such early termination. The Company also shall be entitled to its reasonable attorneys’ or collection fees in connection with recovery of such liquidated damages, and this liquidation of damages provision shall not limit in any way the Company’s rights or remedies to seek and recover from Licensee damages or injunctive relief arising from, or in connection with, causes of action that the Company may have other than for early termination. <br><br>(c) Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement shall not limit either party from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by Licensee, including Termination Fees. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement: (i) the rights granted to Licensee under this Agreement will cease immediately upon the effective date of such termination and be of no further force or effect; and (ii) Licensee shall immediately surrender to the Company any device that stores the Software.</p>
        <span>13. INDEMNITY</span>
        <p> Licensee shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless from and against all loss, liability, damage and expense, including payment of the Company’s reasonable attorneys fees, caused or claimed by Licensee’s customers, officers, employees, agents, vendors, partners or contractors and arising from claims or demands: (a) for damages to property or for injury or death to persons, including without limitation any disability, death or Worker’s Compensation benefits; (b) arising from or relating to data transmitted, received or stored on or over the Company’s network by or through Licensee; (c) for infringement of a third party’s proprietary rights based on any information, materials or access to property provided by Licensee; or (d) relating to the use by Licensee of any Software or Services provided under this Agreement. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. This indemnity and hold harmless provision shall apply to all claims Licensee may bring against any reseller or master licensee of the Company’s Software and Services relating to subject matter of this indemnity provision; to the extent that any such reseller or master licensee may seek contribution or indemnity from Company in connection with such claims, Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold Company harmless Company to the same extent as if the claims against Company were brought by a third party – which is to say that Licensee will provide Company with a full indemnity in such instance, including in connection with the payment of Company’s reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>
        <span>14. MISCELLANEOUS</span>
        <p>(a) Equitable Remedies. Licensee acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach by Licensee of any of the agreements or other or provisions contained in Paragraphs 1, 5, 12 and 13 of this Agreement will result in irreparable and continuing harm to the Company for which the Company would not have adequate remedy at law. Therefore Licensee acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any such breach or threatened breach (or any other breach or act which may otherwise be recognized to be cause irreparable harm), in addition to any other remedy which the Company may have at law or in equity, the Company shall be entitled to such injunctive relief or other equitable remedies to restrain Licensee from violating the provisions of this Agreement and Licensee hereby consents to the granting of such injunctive relief or other equitable remedy by any court of competent jurisdiction, without the Company having to prove the inadequacy of the available remedies at law or any actual damages (and without being required to post a bond or other security). Any such remedy sought or obtained shall not be considered either exclusive or a waiver of the rights of the Company to assert a claim for any other remedies it may have at law or in equity. <br><br> (b) Severability and Waiver. If any term or provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms and provisions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term or provision. The waiver by the Company SOFT of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. <br><br>(c) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without reference to its or any other state’s conflicts of law principles. Except for a “Intellectual Property Disputes” as defined below, the parties agree that all disputes, controversies, or claims between them (and including claims against the Company’s Suppliers) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or concerning the respective obligations hereunder of the parties hereto, shall be settled and determined by final and binding arbitration by a panel of a single arbitrator in accordance with and subject to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), or in the event that such entity is not in operation at the time such proceeding may be commenced, pursuant to the corresponding procedures of JAMS. The location of such arbitration shall be New York County, New York. Each party shall bear its own administrative costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding, including arbitrator’s fees. Licensee waives the right to bring any class arbitration or join as a class member any class arbitration against the Company. <br><br>
        With respect to “Intellectual Property Disputes”, each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, sitting in New York County, and the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New York. “Intellectual Property Disputes” shall be defined as those disputes (i) involving or relating to unauthorized use or copying of the software or improper use of the Company’s trademark rights, and/or (ii) any challenge to, or the enforcement of (including declaratory actions regarding the ownership, validity or infringement of) the intellectual property rights licensed hereunder. <br><br>
        Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party. In any such suit, action or proceeding, each party waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons, complaint or other process and agrees that the service thereof may be made by certified or registered mail, addressed to such party at its address as set forth in the preamble hereinabove. Licensee further waives the right to a jury, and the right to join in (or bring as a class member) a class action against the Company in connection with any claim arising from or in connection with the Software, the Services, any third party services provided via or in connection with the Software. <br><br> (d) Limitation on Actions. Any action for breach of this Agreement or any other action otherwise arising out of this Agreement must be commenced by the party asserting such action within one (1) year from the date the right, claim, demand, or cause of action first occurs (or 1 year from reasonable discovery of the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to such cause of action, if such cause of action is not reasonably discoverable), otherwise, such action shall be barred forever and waived by such party. <br><br>(e) Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any rights granted hereunder may be sold, leased, assigned, or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part by Licensee, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect, without the advance written consent of the Company. The Company may freely assign, delegate, sublicense or transfer its rights and obligations hereunder. <br><br> (f) Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for any delay or failure in performance due to war, acts of terror, riots, embargoes, strikes, accidents, fire, acts of God, supplier or vendor failure, outage or malfunction of local or long distance telecommunications services, utility outage or other occurrence beyond such Party’s direct control (each, a “Force Majeure Event”). The non-performing Party shall notify the other Party of a Force Majeure Event, and if a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) days, the Company or Licensee may cancel this Agreement with no further liability (except for any amounts due and not paid by Licensee) as a result of such Force Majeure Event. <br><br> (g) Attorneys’ Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with such action or arbitral proceeding, including any appeal. <br><br> (h) Notices. All notices required to be sent hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon (i) the date sent by confirmed facsimile, (ii) on the date it was delivered by courier, (iii) by email if to the Company at billing@briskpayments.com, if to Licensee at the email address provided on the Sales Order Form, or (iv) if by certified mail return receipt requested, on the date received, to the addresses set forth above and to the attention of the signatories of this Agreement and the relevant Sales Order Form, or to such other address or individual as the parties may specify from time to time by written notice to the other Party. <br><br>(i) Authorized Individual.
