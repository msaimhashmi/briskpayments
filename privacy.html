        <p>BY USING THIS WEBSITE YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO COMPLY WITH OUR TERMS OF USE AND THE ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT. TOGETHER, THESE DOCUMENTS CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THIS WEBSITE. THE TERMS OF YOUR SPECIFIC USE AND ANY “CONTENT” OR OTHER SOFTWARE OR SERVICE AS DEFINED IN THE MERCHANT USER LICENSE AGREEMENT YOU ENTERED INTO WITH briskpayments (THE “MULA”) ARE GOVERNED BY SUCH MULA. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT AND THE MULA, THE MULA SHALL GOVERN.</p>
        <p>Effective date: 01/06/2013</p>
        <p>briskpayments LLC. d/b/a briskpayments (“briskpayments”, “we”, “us” or “our”) (“briskpayments” or “We”) is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.</p>
        <p>Please read the following Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to understand how your User Specific Information will be treated, as you make use of this Website. This policy may be amended from time to time, so please check it periodically.</p>
        <p>As part of the operations of briskpayments and its related companies, we gather certain types of information about our users through our Website and Web Application. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information gathered, and what we do with it.</p>
        <span>1. Kinds of Information.</span>
        <p>There are two kinds of information we can obtain about you:</p>
        <p>a) User Specific Information: User Specific Information is any information that personally or specifically identifies you or your business. It can be your first and last name, address, your telephone number, age, gender or your e-mail address, depending upon what you voluntarily provide to us through our Contact Us functionality. Unless you provide this information to us, we do not collect User Specific Information. We may, however, also collect e-mail addresses from users who send us support mail or request technical or other help. This information enables us to improve our Website, customer or potential customer database, or services in order to make our products better available.</p>
        <p>b) Aggregate Information: Aggregate Information is anonymous data that we use to diagnose problems on our Website’s servers, administer our Website, determine the regions from which users access our site, and to help improve the quality of our Web pages and direct our promotional efforts. This type of information may be, without limitation, your IP address, browser type, and domain, service provider information, and other information of this type. We may share Aggregate Information with third parties. None of this information is connected with User Specific Information. So, when you enter our site, you are anonymous and will remain that way unless you choose otherwise or unless you utilize any Software through the Website.</p>
        <span>2. Use of Information.</span>
        <p>We may use the User Specific Information we collect to improve the content of our Website; to notify users about updates to our Website or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest; to investigate violations of our terms and conditions of use; and in any other reasonable way that we use the customer or potential customer information we have in our corporate databases. We may also share User Specific Information with consultants and related companies for internal business, marketing, product development or research. We may access User Specific Information on behalf of third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. In some situations, we may share your User Specific Information with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, or in cooperation with us. In addition, we may receive personal usage and demographic information from third parties based on our User Specific Information and visits to our Website, and use such information to improve our products and services.</p>
        <p>We may share the Aggregate Information we collect with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes and we may use a third-party company to serve advertisements when you visit our Website. This company may use Aggregate information about your visits to our Website in order to provide advertisements on our Website about goods and services of interest to you. We may also use Aggregate Information in any way we use User Specific Information, and may use it internally or provide it to third parties.</p>
